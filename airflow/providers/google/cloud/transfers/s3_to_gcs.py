    """
    Synchronizes an S3 key, possibly a prefix, with a Google Cloud Storage
    destination path.

    .. seealso::
        For more information on how to use this operator, take a look at the guide:
        :ref:`howto/operator:S3ToGCSOperator`

    :param bucket: The S3 bucket where to find the objects. (templated)
    :param prefix: Prefix string which filters objects whose name begin with
        such prefix. (templated)
    :param delimiter: the delimiter marks key hierarchy. (templated)
    :param aws_conn_id: The source S3 connection
    :param verify: Whether or not to verify SSL certificates for S3 connection.
        By default SSL certificates are verified.
        You can provide the following values:

        - ``False``: do not validate SSL certificates. SSL will still be used
                 (unless use_ssl is False), but SSL certificates will not be
                 verified.
        - ``path/to/cert/bundle.pem``: A filename of the CA cert bundle to uses.
                 You can specify this argument if you want to use a different
                 CA cert bundle than the one used by botocore.
    :param gcp_conn_id: (Optional) The connection ID used to connect to Google Cloud.
    :param dest_gcs: The destination Google Cloud Storage bucket and prefix
        where you want to store the files. (templated)
    :param replace: Whether you want to replace existing destination files
        or not.
    :param gzip: Option to compress file for upload
    :param google_impersonation_chain: Optional Google service account to impersonate using
        short-term credentials, or chained list of accounts required to get the access_token
        of the last account in the list, which will be impersonated in the request.
        If set as a string, the account must grant the originating account
        the Service Account Token Creator IAM role.
        If set as a sequence, the identities from the list must grant
        Service Account Token Creator IAM role to the directly preceding identity, with first
        account from the list granting this role to the originating account (templated).
